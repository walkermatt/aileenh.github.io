# Loading Other Data Sets #

Loading other data sets follows exactly the same method.

## VectorMap District ##

To load VectorMap District you need to specify a suitable `prep_cmd` to prepare the GML for loading and a corresponding gfs file.

Use the VMD GML preparation routine

    prep_cmd=python prepgml4ogr.py $file_path prep_osgml.prep_vmd

Use the specific VML gfs file tailored to loading into PostgreSQL

    gfs_file=../gfs/vmd_postgres.gfs

Remember to create a suitable schema in the database (e.g. `vmd`) and edit the `ogr_cmd` to load into that schema e.g. `active_schema=vmd`

If you are using the same `src_dir` remember to remove the OSMM data from the folder and copy the new data into the folder.

There is a small sample of VectorMap District data in the sample data supplied.
