# Setting Up the Environment #

## Run Portable GIS ##
Navigate to the drive where you installed the Portable GIS and run the file portablegis.exe

![alt text](http://aileenh.github.io/images/image1.JPG "Portable GIS screen shot")

## Start PostgreSQL ##
Click on the 'Servers Module' tab and click on the 'Start' radio button to start the PostgreSQL Database Server.

You will see the following window appear. Do not dismiss the window, leave it running in the background.

## Run PgAdmin III ##
Click on the 'Desktop Module' tab and click on the PgAdmin III button.

You will see the following window appear. Do not dismiss the window, leave it running in the background.

## Connect to the Test Database ##
Double click on the portable gis server to connect to it.

![alt text](http://aileenh.github.io/images/image10.JPG "Connect to test database")

You will notice there are three databases in the portable gis server. We are going ot use the test database as it already has the PostGIS extension added to it. 

![alt text](http://aileenh.github.io/images/image11.JPG "Connect to test database")

So double click on the test database to expand it.

You will notice that postgis is listed in the extensions for that database.

## Create schema to load data into ##
Right click on the schemas node and select New Schema...

You may call you schema whatever you want but in this workshop we will call ours osmm_topo.
Enter the name of the schema in the name text box and then click on the OK button.

## Edit loader config file ##
So now we have the database schema to load the data into we need to edit the configuration file for Loader. 

There are only 7 configuration items for Loader. 

**`src_dir`**:
The directory containing your source files or an individual file. All supported files in the specified directory and it's descendants will be loaded.

**`out_dir`**:
The directory used to store the translated data if writing to a file based format such as ESRI Shape, MapInfo TAB etc.

**`temp_dir`**: The directory used to store temporary working files during loading.

**`ogr_cmd`**: 
The ogr2ogr command that will be used to load the data. Here you can specify the destination format and any associated settings (for example database connection details if you are writing to PostGIS).

**`prep_cmd`**: 
The command used to prepare the source data so it is suitable for loading with OGR, choose one that is suitable for your source data such as `prep_osgml.prep_osmm_topo` for OS MasterMap Topo.

**`post_cmd`**: 
An optional command to be run once OGR has created it's output. Called once per file, useful for loading SQL dump files etc.

**`gfs_file`**: OGR `.gfs` file used to define the feature attributes and geometry type of the features read from the GML again choose a suitable gfs file for your source data such as `../gfs/osmm_topo_postgres.gfs` for loading OS MasterMap Topo into PostgreSQL.

Once you have a configuration file set up for a specific data source you can save it and use it again and again.

You will find there are a number of different gfs files and preparation commands (`prep_cmd`) files for different data types in the Loader repository. The Loader wiki also has a section on [configuration examples](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Configuration-examples).

In this workshop we will detail the configuration setting for loading OS MasterMap Topographic layer in a PostgreSQL database.

First we need to create the `src_dir`, `out_dir` and `temp_dir`. These can be any directory on your device e.g. `c:\temp\loader\src_dir`, `c:\temp\loader\out_dir` and `c:\temp\loader\temp_dir`

Now we need to edit the config file. 

On the 'Desktop Module' tab of the Portable GIS control panel, click on the 'Edit Config' button.

![alt text](http://aileenh.github.io/images/image4.JPG "Edit Loader Config")

This will fire up a text editor.

Edit the configuration items as follows:

    src_dir=c:\temp\loader\scr_dir

    out_dir=c:\temp\loader\out_dir

    tmp_dir=c:\temp\loader\temp_dir

    ogr_cmd=ogr2ogr --config GML_EXPOSE_FID NO -append -skipfailures -f PostgreSQL PG:'dbname=temp active_schema=osmm_topo host=127.0.0.1 port=5434 user=pgis password=pgis' $file_path

    prep_cmd=python prepgml4ogr.py $file_path prep_osgml.prep_osmm_topo

    gfs_file=../gfs/osmm_topo_postgres.gfs

    debug=False

Because we are loading the data into PostGIS we need to specify the host and port for the database as part of the `ogr_cmd` option. We are connecting to the database using the default database superuser for the portable gis which is `pgis` (with password `pgis`). The `active_schema` is where we wish to load the data into i.e. `osmm_topo`

You can leave `debug` to be `False` but if you run into problems you can set it to `True` to help identify where the problem is as it prints more information while loading and does not delete any temporary files.

Save your changed and exit the editor.

Now we have everything set up
